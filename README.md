# aspect-based-sentiment-classification-model

This is a neural network model built with Keras library to classify branch customer reviews into three aspects: service quality, staff friendliness and line (waiting time). Due to various reasons, the uploaded notebook is the prototype version trained with only 100+ reviews, you can train your model with more data to fit your problem better. Feel free to play with the neural network architecture as well!
