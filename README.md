# aspect-based-sentiment-classification-model

Hello!

This is a neural network model built with Keras library to classify branch customer reviews into three aspects: service quality, staff friendliness and line (waiting time). In addition, you can also analyse the sentiment of the reviews. Due to various reasons, the uploaded notebook is the prototype version trained with only 100+ reviews. Still, you can see the model works pretty well with unseen reviews at the end. 

You can train your model with more data to fit your problem better. Feel free to play with the neural network architecture and parameters as well!
